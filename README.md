# README for Honors Biology 101 Performance Analysis at NotReal University

## Introduction

This repository details a comprehensive study aimed at identifying factors influencing academic performance in the Honors Biology 101 course at NotReal University. 
The project delves into various determinants like study habits, attendance, and demographic factors to understand their impact on student outcomes in this rigorous course.

## Study Overview

The primary objective is to analyze the interplay between several key variables and final grades in Honors Biology 101. The variables include 
Study Hours Per Week, Classes Missed, Age, and Gender, each providing unique insights into the factors contributing to academic success in a challenging educational setting.

## Key Variables

- **Study_Hours_Per_Week**: Measures the time students dedicate to studying outside of class sessions.
- **Classes_Missed**: Captures the attendance pattern, highlighting its importance in academic achievement.
- **Age**: Considered as an indicator of maturity and experience, potentially influencing performance.
- **Gender**: Examined to ascertain any impact on educational outcomes within the course.

## Key Findings

- A significant positive correlation was found between the number of study hours per week and final grades, highlighting the importance of dedicated study time.
- There is a notable negative correlation between the number of classes missed and final grades, emphasizing the critical role of consistent attendance for success in the course.

## Recommendations

- Implement mandatory study hours for students enrolled in this course.
- Implement an intervention system where professors reach out to students who miss too many classes in order to help improve student performance.

## Implications

The insights from this analysis underscore the value of encouraging effective study habits and regular class attendance among students. These findings can guide instructors and 
educational policymakers in developing strategies to enhance student engagement and academic performance in Honors Biology 101.

## Future Work

Future research could expand on this study by exploring additional variables or applying the findings to other courses and contexts to further understand the dynamics of 
academic performance.
